this project is a simple closed loop system that monitors the blood suger level in the human body then alarms the person 
if the blood sugar is at a certain level below 70 ml/dl (hypoglycemia)
also injects glucose to the blood to maintin a healthy blood sugar level.

the glucuose level is represented by the voltage (0: 5v) controlled by the potentiometer .
the signal is scaled from (0 : 1023) to (0: 150 ml/dl) the glucuose range.

the glucose shot is injected by the servo motor .

the alarm is the led .
